results and implications discussed in part E2

## Task_2

One of the most critical factors in patient relationship management that directly affects a hospital’s longterm cost-effectiveness is understanding its patients and the conditions leading to hospital admissions.
When a hospital can better understand its patients’ characteristics, it is better able to target treatment to
patients, resulting in more effective cost of care for the hospital in the long term.
You are an analyst for a hospital that wants to better understand the characteristics of its patients. You have
been asked to use PCA to analyze patient data to identify the principal variables of your patients, ultimately
allowing better business and strategic decision-making for the hospital.

Part I: Research Question     
A. Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:
1. Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer by using
principal component analysis (PCA).
2. Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the
scenario and is represented in the available data.

Part II: Method Justification      
B. Explain the reasons for using PCA by doing the following:
1. Explain how PCA analyzes the selected data set. Include expected outcomes.
2. Summarize one assumption of PCA.

Part III: Data Preparation     
C. Perform data preparation for the chosen dataset by doing the following:
1. Identify the continuous dataset variables that you will need in order to answer the PCA question
proposed in part A1.
2. Standardize the continuous dataset variables identified in part C1. Include a copy of the cleaned
dataset.

Part IV: Analysis       
D. Perform PCA by doing the following:
1. Determine the matrix of all the principal components.
2. Identify the total number of principal components using the elbow rule or the Kaiser criterion. Include
a screenshot of the scree plot.
3. Identify the variance of each of the principal components identified in part D2.
4. Identify the total variance captured by the principal components identified in part D2.
5. Summarize the results of your data analysis.

Part V: Attachments     
E. Record the web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the analysis.
Ensure the web sources are reliable.

F. Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased or
summarized.

G. Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

## Task_3   

One of the most critical factors in patient relationship management that directly affects a
hospital’s long-term cost effectiveness is understanding its patients and the conditions leading to
hospital admissions. When a hospital can better understand its patients’ characteristics, it is
better able to target treatment to patients, resulting in more effective cost of care for the hospital
in the long term.
You are an analyst for a hospital that wants to better understand the characteristics of its
patients. You have been asked to perform a market basket analysis to analyze patient data to
identify key associations of your patients, ultimately allowing better business and strategic
decision-making for the hospital.

Part I: Research Question    
A. Describe the purpose of this data mining report by doing the following:
1. Propose one question relevant to a real-world organizational situation that you will answer using
market basket analysis.
2. Define one goal of the data analysis. Ensure that your goal is reasonable within the scope of the
scenario and is represented in the available data.

Part II: Market Basket Justification     
B. Explain the reasons for using market basket analysis by doing the following:
1. Explain how market basket analyzes the selected dataset. Include expected outcomes.
2. Provide one example of transactions in the dataset.
3. Summarize one assumption of market basket analysis.

Part III: Data Preparation and Analysis      
C. Prepare and perform market basket analysis by doing the following:
1. Transform the dataset to make it suitable for market basket analysis. Include a copy of the cleaned
dataset.
2. Execute the code used to generate association rules with the Apriori algorithm. Provide screenshots
that demonstrate the error-free functionality of the code.
3. Provide values for the support, lift, and confidence of the association rules table.
4. Identify the top three rules generated by the Apriori algorithm. Include a screenshot of the top rules along with their summaries. 

Part IV: Data Summary and Implications     
D. Summarize your data analysis by doing the following:
1. Summarize the significance of support, lift, and confidence from the results of the analysis.
2. Discuss the practical significance of the findings from the analysis.
3. Recommend a course of action for the real-world organizational situation from part A1 based on your results from part D1.

Part V: Attachments     
E. Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a demonstration of the functionality of the code used for the analysis and a summary of the programming environment.

F. Record all web sources used to acquire data or segments of third-party code to support the application. Ensure the web sources are reliable.
